## Definitions

**Type Annotations**
Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value. Variable will refer to
Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

### Arrays

**Typed Arrays**
Arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

**Why do we care about arrays in typescript?**

- Typescript can do type inference when extracting values from an array
- Typescript can prevent us from adding incompatible values to an array
- We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions
- Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types
